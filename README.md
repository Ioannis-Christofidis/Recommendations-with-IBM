numpy
<br>

## Purpose of this project
For this project we will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles we think they will like.

## File Description
There is a notebook and data folder. Notebook is developed to answer the questions of this project. We explored and prepared the data dropping the irrelevant values and replacing the missing values. As a result, we extract the results that they answered to our questions. 

## Results 
 we built suitable recommendation engines corresponding to the user's demands. To be more specific, we developed rank-based recommendation engines and user-user collaborative filtering engines
 
 ## Acknowledgements
 
 Must give credit to Udacity for having access to the data through it.
